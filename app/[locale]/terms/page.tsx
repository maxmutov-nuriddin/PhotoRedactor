            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Screenshot Studio is a free, browser-based screenshot editing tool
              that allows users to beautify screenshots with backgrounds,
              frames, effects, and more. Editing happens in your browser, and images
              you import are not uploaded to edit them. Exporting sends the
              finished image to our compression endpoint, which returns it
              without storing it, and capturing a screenshot from a URL sends
              that address to a third-party capture service. Our{" "}

              The Service is free to use and is supported by ads served by
              Google AdSense. Ads are provided by third parties, and we are not
              responsible for the products or services they promote. You agree
              not to click ads artificially, use automated tools to generate ad

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Some features rely on third-party services, such as Microlink for

              own terms and privacy policies. How ads, analytics, and cookies
